abstract: |
  During the spring and summer of 2020, many cities across the world adopted a
  policy of converting roadway facilities into open pedestrian spaces. This
  policy was designed to meaningfully improve access to public recreation areas, 
  but the degree to which this access improved among different populations is an
  important research question. In particular, academic and practical methods 
  to measure socio-spatial access to park facilites rely on arbitrary definitions
  and are not based in revealed preferences for park facilities. In this study,
  we evaluate the change in a utility-based park accessibility measure resulting 
  from street conversions in Alameda County, California. Our utility-based 
  accessibility measure is constructed from a park activity location choice model
  we estimate using mobile device data --- supplied by StreetLight Data, Inc. ---
  representing trips to parks in that county. The estimated model reveals
  heterogeneity in inferred affinity for park attributes among different
  sociodemographic groups. When applied to the street conversion policy in 
  Alameda County, the model suggests an aggregate household-level consumer surplus
  of over $100 thousand (per park trip frequency). This surplus is pro-social
  in that Black and low-income households receive a greater share of the 
  surplus than expected based on the population distribution.

# Introduction {#intro}
Parks and other green spaces generate immense value for the public who are able
to access them. The @CityParksAlliance categorizes the observed benefits of
urban parks as encouraging active lifestyles [@Bancroft2015], contributing to
local economies, aiding in stormwater management and flood mitigation,
improving local air quality, increasing community engagement [@Madzia2018], and
enhancing public equity.

For many, the value of public parks and open public spaces increased during the
widespread lockdowns enacted in 2020 to slow the transmission of COVID-19. With
many other entertainment venues shuttered and people otherwise confined to their
homes, periodic use of public space provided many with emotional relief
unavailable in other forms. Paired with this increased demand for public open
space --- and the with the epidemiological requirement to leave sufficient space
between other users --- was the related collapse in demand for vehicular travel.
As a result, cities around the world began closing select streets to automobile
travel, thereby opening them as pedestrian plazas. The effective result of this
policy was to create a number of "parks" in urban areas that may have had
poor access previously. Understanding the equitable distribution of these
benefits is an important land use policy issue. The potential for non-emergency
temporary or permanent street conversions also brings up interesting problems
for land use and transportation policy; indeed, the possibility for
transportation infrastructure to itself become a socially beneficial land use is
a tantalizing proposition.

Unfortunately, quantifying the benefits derived from access to parks in general
is a complicated problem. Many previous attempts at quantifying access in terms
of isochronal distances or greenspace concentration have resulted in a
frustrating lack of clarity on the relationship between thus measured access and
measures of physical and emotional health [@Bancroft2015]. Central to this
confusion is the simple fact that people do not always use the nearest park,
especially if it does not have qualities that they find attractive. A better
methodology would be to evaluate the park activity location choices of people in
a metropolitan area to identify which features of parks --- distance, amenities,
size, etc. --- are valued and which are less valued. The resulting activity
location choice model would enable the evaluation of utility benefits via the
choice model logsum [@Handy1997; @DeJong2007].

In this study, we seek to evaluate the socio-spatial distribution of benefits
received by residents of Alameda County, California resulting from the 
temporary conversion of streets to public open spaces during the spring and summer
of 2020. We estimate a park activity location choice model using location-based
services (LBS) data obtained through StreetLight Data, Inc., a commercial data 
aggregator. The resulting model illuminates the degree to which constructed
individuals living in U.S. Census block groups of varying sociodemographic
characteristics value the travel distance between block group and parks, the
size of the parks, and the amenities of parks including sport fields,
playgrounds, and walking trails in Alameda county. We then apply this model to
examine the inferred monetary benefit resulting from the street conversion
policy, and its distribution among different sociodemographic groups.

The paper proceeds in the following manner: A [discussion](#literature) of prior attempts to
evaluate park accessibility and preferences is given directly. A [Methodology](#methodology)
section presents our data gathering and cleaning efforts as well as the
econometric framework for the location choice model. A [Results](#results) section
presents the estimated choice model coefficients alongside a discussion of their
implications, followed by an analysis of the implied benefits resulting from the
street conversion policy. After presenting [limitations](#limitations) and associated avenues
for future research, a final [Conclusions](#conclusions) section outlines the contributions of
this study for recreational trip modeling and location choice modeling more
generally.
