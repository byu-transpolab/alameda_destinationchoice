abstract: |
  Parks provide important benefits to those who live near them, in the form of improved property values, health outcomes, etc.; nevertheless, measuring and understanding who lives near a park is an open research question. In particular, it is not well understood which park individuals will choose to use when given a choice among a set of nearby parks of varying sizes and at varying distances from their home. In this paper we present a park activity location choice model estimated from a passive origin-destination dataset --- supplied by StreetLight Data, Inc. --- representing trips to parks and green spaces in Alameda County, California. The estimated model parameters reveal heterogeneous preferences for park size and willingness-to-travel across block-group level socioeconomic segmentation: Specifically, high-income block groups appear more positively attracted to larger parks, and block groups with a high proportion of ethnic minority individuals are more likely to select nearby parks. The findings have importance for understanding recreational access among different populations, and the methodology more generally supplies a potential template for using passive data products within travel modeling.

# Introduction {#intro}
Parks and other green spaces generate immense value for the public who are able
to access them. The @CityParksAlliance categorizes the observed benefits of
urban parks as encouraging active lifestyles [@Bancroft2015], contributing to
local economies, aiding in stormwater management and flood mitigation,
improving local air quality, increasing community engagement [@Madzia2018], and
enhancing public equity.

Nevertheless, understanding and quantifying these benefits depends in many
cases on identifying who lives near the parks and is therefore able to access
them. Many previous studies [e.g., @Richardson2012] rely on comparison of total
greenspace across metropolitan areas; this methodology may not adequately
control for city-level fixed effects and it may ignore the potentially
inequitable distribution of park space within a region. Studies focusing on
access within metropolitan areas typically assume that people living within a
certain distance or travel time threshold have access to a park, or examine the
quantity of park space within one's own arbitrarily defined "neighborhood"
[@Mitchell2008,Stark2014]. But these methods do not account for the fact that
some people will travel to other parks to perform recreational activities. A
more holistic measure that continuously measures access across multiple
preference dimensions is desirable.

An appealing solution would be to examine and model the activity location
choices of park users. Such a model would help researchers understand how
individuals of different backgrounds and preferences value different park
amenities. Further, the logsums of a location choice model provide a continuous
measure of accessibility that explicitly accounts for such variation
[@DeJong2007]. Unfortunately, park choice models of this form are rare in the
literature. Travel demand models built for infrastructure forecasting are a
common way to generate such accessibility logsums, but these models group many
different kinds of social and recreational trips together [@nchrp716]. Further,
the attraction term for such trip purposes is commonly a function of the retail
or service employment or the number of households at the destination; a typical
park or green space has neither employees nor residents. Finally, many regional
household travel surveys are oriented towards an average weekday travel
pattern, and many park trips occur irregularly or on weekends.

In this paper we present a park destination choice model where individuals
living in Alameda County, California choose among parks in the same county. The
individuals are constructed from passive data that was derived from mobile
devices and processed using algorithms developed by StreetLight Data, Inc. The
origin location points are inferred residence block groups for unique devices
and the destination points are geofenced polygons representing green and open
spaces. The individualsâ€™ choice of park location is conditioned on the distance
from the block group to the parks in the choice set as well as the size of each
park; market segmentation allows for heterogeneous responses between ethnic
groups and income strata.

The paper proceeds in the following manner: A discussion of prior attempts to
study park choice and employ passive origin-destination data in the literature
is given directly. The Methodology section presents the data gathering and
cleaning efforts as well as the econometric location choice model. The Results
section presents the estimated model coefficients and a discussion of the
findings, as well as a model validation exercise. After presenting limitations
and associated avenues for future research, a final Conclusions section
outlines the contributions of this study for recreational trip modeling and
location choice modeling more generally.
