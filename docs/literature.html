<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Defining and measuring park accessibility</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Handy and Niemeier (<a href="#ref-Handy1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> identify three broad types of accessibility measures: cumulative
opportunity measures, gravity-based measures, and utility-based measures.
<span class="citation">Geurs and van Wee (<a href="#ref-GEURS2004127" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> classify cumulative opportunity and gravity-based measures into
a single category that they refer to as location-based measures. Researchers
have applied versions of location-based measures and, to a lesser degree,
utility-based measures to quantify park accessibility</p>
<div id="location-based-measures-of-park-accessibility" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Location-based measures of park accessibility</h3>
<p>Cumulative opportunity measures are calculated by counting the number of origins
or destinations within a threshold travel cost of a location (where cost might
be some combination of distance, travel time, and/or monetary cost of travel). A
strength of cumulative opportunity measures lies in their simplicity and
intuitive interpretation. However, they may be too simple, especially with
regard to trip costs near the threshold. An example of a cumulative opportunity
measure might be the number of parks within a ten-minute walk of a person’s
home, or the number of households living within ten minutes of a park. This
measure would imply that a household living immediately adjacent to a park has
the same access to it as one that lives nine minutes away, but that a household
living eleven minutes away has no access to it.</p>
<p>ParkScore <span class="citation">(Trust for Public Land <a href="#ref-parkscore2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, developed by the Trust for Public Land, is a popular
measure of park accessibility that starts from a cumulative opportunity measure
(the share of the population that resides within a 10-minute walk of a green
space) and adjusts this value based on the total city green space, investment,
and amenities weighted against the socioeconomic characteristics of the
population outside of the 10-minute walk threshold. The resulting score is a
convenient quantitative tool in estimating the relative quality of green space
access across cities <span class="citation">(Rigolon, Browning, and Jennings <a href="#ref-Rigolon2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. It may be less useful at identifying the
comparative quality of access within a city, particularly since more than 95% of
residents in many dense metropolitan areas like San Francisco and New York may
live within the binary 10-minute walk threshold [citation needed]. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed an “Accessibility to
Parks Indicator” along similar lines <span class="citation">(Ussery et al. <a href="#ref-Ussery2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, calculating the share of the
population living within a half-mile of a park for each county in the U.S.</p>
<p>Gravity-based accessibility measures take a similar approach to cumulative
opportunity measures, but theoretically include all possible destinations and
weight them according to the travel cost that they impose, based on an impedance
function. Cumulative opportunity measures may be considered a special case of
gravity-based measures, where the impedance function takes the form of a binary
step function that equals zero after a cutoff travel cost (which is why
<span class="citation">Geurs and van Wee (<a href="#ref-GEURS2004127" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> classify them both as location-based). The inverse square function
is a common form of impedance function for gravity-based accessibility measures.</p>
<p>A major advantage of gravity-based accessibility measures lies in their
consistency with travel behavior theory: Gravity-based measures have their roots
in the trip-distribution step of the traditional four-step travel demand
forecasting method, where trips originating in a particular zone are distributed
among destination zones, proportionate to each zone’s gravity-based
accessibility. Urban scholars have used gravity-based measures to explore the
spatial distribution of park access across Tainan City, Taiwan
<span class="citation">(Chang and Liao <a href="#ref-chang2011exploring" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> and to estimate the relationship between park access and
housing prices in Shenzhen, China <span class="citation">(Wu et al. <a href="#ref-wu2017spatial" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Some scholars have used location-based measures of park accessibility to
evaluate equity in park access. <span class="citation">Chang and Liao (<a href="#ref-chang2011exploring" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> use a gravity-based measure
to determine that low-income neighborhoods have less access to parks than
higher-income neighborhoods in Tainan City, Taiwan. <span class="citation">Bruton and Floyd (<a href="#ref-bruton2014disparities" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>
conduct a neighborhood-level analysis of park amenities in Greensboro, North
Carolina, and find that low-income neighborhoods tend to have parks with more
picnic areas, more trash cans, and fewer wooded areas, but they do not address
the question of the extent to which different populations might value these
different amenities. <span class="citation">Kabisch and Haase (<a href="#ref-kabisch2014green" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> find that neighborhoods in Berlin with
high immigrant populations and older populations likewise had less access to
parks, and they pair these findings with survey results suggesting that these
disparities are not consistent with the preferences expressed by those
populations.</p>
<p>The question of whether uneven distribution of parks and park amenities might
reflect local preferences could be more appropriately addressed using
utility-based measures of park accessibility (as discussed below) and though
qualitative studies (as discussed in the following section).</p>
</div>
<div id="utility-based-measures-of-park-accessibility" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Utility-based measures of park accessibility</h3>
<p>While traditional four-step travel demand models distribute zonal trips based on
a gravity-based accessibility model, the travel demand modeling profession has
shifted more recently towards a destination choice framework that distributes
trips based on discrete-choice regression models. <span class="citation">D. McFadden (<a href="#ref-mcfadden1974measurement" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span> first applied
discrete choice models to urban travel demand to predict mode choice, and
activity-based models apply them to all travel behavior choices, including to
select among alternative routes or alternative destinations <span class="citation">(Dios Ortúzar and Willumsen <a href="#ref-de2011modelling" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.
Though the application of random utility models to destination choice is not new
<span class="citation">(see Anas <a href="#ref-anas1983discrete" role="doc-biblioref">1983</a>)</span>, the increasing availability of computing resources makes
estimating and applying discrete choice models on large alternative sets in a
practical context more feasible.</p>
<p>When applied to destination choice, discrete choice models estimate the
likelihood of selecting a particular destination among a set of alternatives
based on the relative attractiveness, or <em>utility</em>, of each alternative. Utility
may be function of distance or travel time alone (in which case, a utility-based
accessibility measure might be quite similar to a location-based measure), but
it can also incorporate other destination characteristics that lead one
destination to be more highly-utilized than another. For a utility-based measure
of park accessibility, these might include park size or park amenities.</p>
<p>Destination-choice models have not commonly been used to measure park
accessibility, scholars have acknowledged that park accessibility metrics should
be linked with park use, since a park that has many visitors must by definition
be accessible to those visitors. <span class="citation">McCormack et al. (<a href="#ref-McCormack2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> provide a comprehensive review
of this literature; it is sufficient here to note that most studies find park
use to depend on a complicated interplay between park size, maintenance,
facilities, and travel distance. Many of these attributes are incorporated into
ParkIndex <span class="citation">(Kaczynski et al. <a href="#ref-Kaczynski2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, which estimates the resident park use potential
within <span class="math inline">\(100 m^2\)</span> grid cells, based on a household park use survey in Kansas
City.</p>
<p>The park use potential measured by ParkIndex is not dissimilar from a park trip
production potential, as used by transportation planners and engineers. Along
these lines, the question of park use is a destination choice problem, where
trip makers consider which park is most attractive to accomplish their
recreation activity. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ite2019" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> contains trip attraction rates for public parks
that use the park acreage, number of picnic tables, employees, and other
variables as attraction terms. As with many land uses in Trip Generation, the
provided trip generation rates are based on a limited number of observational
samples <span class="citation">(Shoup <a href="#ref-shoup_truth_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> and may not represent large-sample behavior
<span class="citation">(Millard-Ball <a href="#ref-Millard-Ball2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. Moreover, regression-based attraction rates isolated from
trip production and travel behavior ignore the geographical and behavioral
contexts in which people actually make trips to parks <span class="citation">(Barnard and Brindle <a href="#ref-Barnard1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>: Though
more people may come to larger parks, planners cannot bring more people to a
park simply by increasing its size.</p>
<p>There are limited examples of researchers using a destination choice model to
predict recreation attractions. <span class="citation">Kinnell et al. (<a href="#ref-Kinnell2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> apply a choice model to a survey of
park visitors in New Jersey, and estimate the relative attractiveness of park
attributes including playgrounds, picnic areas, and park acreage weighed against
the travel disutility and the relative crime rate at the destination. In a
similar study, <span class="citation">Meyerhoff, Dehnhardt, and Hartje (<a href="#ref-Meyerhoff2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> model the urban swimming location choice for a
surveyed sample. In both studies, the researchers were attempting to ascertain
which attributes of a recreation generated the most positive utility, and
therefore which attributes should be prioritized for improvement. These studies
have not to our knowledge been previously referenced in discussions of park
accessibility.</p>
<p>One obstacle to estimating discrete-choice models to estimate park choice has
been the lack of sufficiently detailed, trip-level data. The advent of
large-scale mobile networks and the seemingly perpetual association of unique
devices with unique users has given researchers a new opportunity to observe the
movements and activity location patterns for large subsets of the population
<span class="citation">(Naboulsi et al. <a href="#ref-Naboulsi2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. Such passively collected movement data — sometimes referred
to as “Big Data” — is a by-product of other systems including cellular call
data records <span class="citation">(e.g., Bolla and Davoli <a href="#ref-Bolla2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>; Calabrese et al. <a href="#ref-Calabrese2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, probe GPS data <span class="citation">(Huang and Levinson <a href="#ref-Huang2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>,
and more recently Location Based Services (LBS) <span class="citation">(Roll <a href="#ref-Roll2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Komanduri et al. <a href="#ref-Komanduri2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. LBS
use a network of mobile applications that obtain the users’ physical location. A
variety of commercial vendors repackage, clean, and scale these data to
population or traffic targets and sell origin-destination matrices to
researchers and practitioners at relatively low prices. <span class="citation">Monz et al. (<a href="#ref-Monz2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, for example,
demonstrate how passive device data can be used to accurately estimate trips to
natural
recreation areas.</p>
<p>Passive origin-destination matrices are beginning to inform trip distribution
model development more directly as well. <span class="citation">Kressner (<a href="#ref-tf_idea" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> proposes one methodology,
where passive origin-destination matrices serve as a probabilistic sampling
frame for a simulated trip destination choice. <span class="citation">Bernardin et al. (<a href="#ref-Bernardin2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> employ a passive
origin-destination matrix as a shadow price reference in an activity-based
location choice model, iteratively adjusting the parameters of the choice
utilities to minimize the observed error between the matrix and the modeled
predictions. A similar method developed by <span class="citation">Zhu and Ye (<a href="#ref-Zhu2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> uses the passive dataset
directly, sampling 10,000 random trips from GPS traces of taxi trips in Shanghai
and estimating a destination choice model. Employing the passive data set in
this way provides the authors an opportunity to examine the choices of a large
sample of a small population (taxi passengers) as well as sufficient data to
estimate a “constants-rich” destination choice model with uniquely estimated
coefficients for each origin-destination pair. The <span class="citation">Zhu and Ye (<a href="#ref-Zhu2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> methodology suggests
that a similar approach should apply in other contexts, including park choice.
Applying these models to park choice allows us to not only predict potential
park use, but also determine which park characteristics are most valuable to
particular populations. The results of such an analysis offer an important
complement to existing qualitative and survey-based research on park use by
marginalized populations.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Sociodemographic variation in park utility</h2>
<p>The idea that different racial, ethnic, or cultural groups have different

<p><span class="citation">Byrne and Wolch (<a href="#ref-byrne2009nature" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span> criticize such scholarship as having grossly exaggerated
ethno-racial differences in park use and preferences, and suggest a model for
explaining park use based on four elements: Sociodemographic characteristics;
park amenities and surrounding land uses; historical/cultural context of park
provision (including development politics and discriminatory land-use
policies); and individual perceptions of park space (including safety and
sense of welcome).</p>
<p><span class="citation">Byrne (<a href="#ref-byrne2012green" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> applies a cultural politics theoretical frame to why people of
color are underrepresented among visitors to some urban parks. Focus groups of
Latino residents emphasized the importance of parks to children and childhood.
Participants described visiting parks with their children and the positive and
negatives associations that parks evoked of their own childhood memories of
parks and wilderness. Participants described barriers to visiting parks
including distance, inadequate or poorly maintained facilities, and fear of
crime. They cited a lack of Spanish-language signage not only as a barrier to
understanding but also as a signal that a park was not intended to serve
Spanish speakers. Participants also expressed that they did not feel welcome
in parks located in high-income or predominantly white neighborhoods, either
because they expected that other park users would have racist attitudes, or
because they expected that a more boisterous Latino ‘recreational style’ would
not be tolerated or that there would be other behavioral norms they were not
aware of.</p>
<p>In an observational and survey-based study of park users in Los Angeles,
<span class="citation">Loukaitou-Sideris (<a href="#ref-loukaitou1995urban" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span> found a high-level of enthusiasm for park use among Hispanic
people. While she found, consistent with prior research <span class="citation">(Baas, Ewert, and Chavez <a href="#ref-baas1993influence" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>; Hutchison <a href="#ref-hutchison1987ethnicity" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>; Irwin, Gartner, and Phelps <a href="#ref-irwin1990mexican" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span>, that Hispanic park users showed a
preference for passive recreation, she found that to be the case for all other
user groups as well. She also found that Hispanic park users were the most
likely to actively appropriate and modify park space, for example, by bringing
items from home. She found that Hispanic park users tended to visit parks as
family groups; African American park users tended to visit parks as peer groups;
Caucasian park users tended to visit parks alone; and Asian residents were least
likely to visit parks, even in a predominantly Asian neighborhood. Interviews
with local elderly Asian residents (Chinese immigrants) suggested that a lack of
interest in American parks was rooted in perceptions of the ideal park as “an
aesthetic element of gorgeous design,” leaving them unimpressed with poorly
landscaped American parks emphasizing recreational functions.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Changing park systems in response to a global pandemic</h2>
<p>[placeholder for literature on COVID shifting streets - will draw heavily from
Tab Combs’ working paper]</p>
<p>The definition of an urban park is not well-established, though some might echo
Justice Potter Stewart in arguing that we know one when we see one
<span class="citation">(“Jacobellis V. Ohio” <a href="#ref-1964jacobellis" role="doc-biblioref">1964</a>)</span>. If we define an urban park as a public space that is
designated for the purpose of recreation, exercise, and social gathering, then
the rapid reallocation of street space that occurred in response to the global
COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and 2020 could be characterized as a proliferation of
small urban parks. During that same period, many municipalities closed specific
park amenities including playgrounds and restrooms.</p>
<p>How might these combined actions have changed the distribution of park utility,
benefits, or access among different populations of park users?</p>
