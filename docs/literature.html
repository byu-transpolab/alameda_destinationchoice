<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Defining and measuring park accessibility</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Handy and Niemeier (<a href="#ref-Handy1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> identify three broad types of accessibility measures: cumulative opportunity measures, gravity-based measures, and utility-based measures. <span class="citation">Geurs and van Wee (<a href="#ref-GEURS2004127" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> classify cumulative opportunity and gravity-based measures into a single category that they refer to as location-based measures. Researchers have applied versions of location-based measures and, to a lesser degree, utility-based measures to quantify park accessibility</p>
<div id="location-based-measures-of-park-accessibility" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Location-based measures of park accessibility</h3>
<p>Cumulative opportunity measures are calculated by counting the number of origins or destinations within a threshold travel cost of a location (where cost might be some combination of distance, travel time, and/or monetary cost of travel). A strength of cumulative opportunity measures lies in their simplicity and intuitive interpretation. However, they may be too simple, especially with regard to trip costs near the threshold. An example of a cumulative opportunity measure might be the number of parks within a ten-minute walk of a person’s home, or the number of households living within ten minutes of a park. This measure would imply that a household living immediately adjacent to a park has the same access to it as one that lives nine minutes away, but that a household living eleven minutes away has no access to it.</p>
<p>ParkScore <span class="citation">(Trust for Public Land <a href="#ref-parkscore2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, developed by the Trust for Public Land, is a popular measure of park accessibility that starts from a cumulative opportunity measure (the share of the population that resides within a 10-minute walk of a green space) and adjusts this value based on the total city green space, investment, and amenities weighted against the socioeconomic characteristics of the population outside of the 10-minute walk threshold. The resulting score is a convenient quantitative tool in estimating the relative quality of green space access across cities <span class="citation">(Rigolon, Browning, and Jennings <a href="#ref-Rigolon2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>. It may be less useful at identifying the comparative quality of access within a city, particularly since more than 95% of residents in many dense metropolitan areas like San Francisco and New York may live within the binary 10-minute walk threshold [citation needed]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed an “Accessibility to Parks Indicator” along similar lines <span class="citation">(Ussery et al. <a href="#ref-Ussery2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, calculating the share of the population living within a half-mile of a park for each county in the U.S.</p>
<p>Gravity-based accessibility measures take a similar approach to cumulative opportunity measures, but theoretically include all possible destinations and weight them according to the travel cost that they impose, based on an impedance function. Cumulative opportunity measures may be considered a special case of gravity-based measures, where the impedance function takes the form of a binary step function that equals zero after a cutoff travel cost (which is why <span class="citation">Geurs and van Wee (<a href="#ref-GEURS2004127" role="doc-biblioref">2004</a>)</span> classify them both as location-based). The inverse square function is a common form of impedance function for gravity-based accessibility measures. A major advantage of gravity-based accessibility measures lies in their consistency with travel behavior theory: Gravity-based measures have their roots in the trip-distribution step of the traditional four-step travel demand forecasting method, where trips originating in a particular zone are distributed among destiation zones, proportionate to each zone’s gravity-based accessibility. Urban scholars have used gravity-based measures to explore the spatial distribution of park access across Tainan City, Taiwan <span class="citation">(Chang and Liao <a href="#ref-chang2011exploring" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> and to estimate the relationship between park access and housing prices in Shenzhen, China <span class="citation">(Wu et al. <a href="#ref-wu2017spatial" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Some scholars have used location-based measures of park accessibility to evaluate equity in park access. <span class="citation">Chang and Liao (<a href="#ref-chang2011exploring" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> use a gravity-based measure to determine whether low-income neighborhoods have less access to parks than higher-income neighborhoods. <span class="citation">Bruton and Floyd (<a href="#ref-bruton2014disparities" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> conduct a neighborhood-level analysis of park amenities and find that low-income neighborhoods tend to have parks with more picnic areas, more trash cans, and fewer wooded areas, but they do not address the question of the extent to which different populations might value these different amenities. Those questions may be more appropriately addressed using utility-based measures of park accessibility (as discussed below) and though qualitative studies (as discussed in the following section).</p>
</div>
<div id="utility-based-measures-of-park-accessibility" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Utility-based measures of park accessibility</h3>
<p>While traditional four-step travel demand models distribute zonal trips based on a gravity-based accessibility model, the travel demand modeling profession has shifted more recently towards activity-based models that distribute trips based on discrete-choice regression models. <span class="citation">McFadden (<a href="#ref-mcfadden1974measurement" role="doc-biblioref">1974</a>)</span> first applied discrete choice models to urban travel demand to predict mode choice, and activity-based models apply them to all travel behavior choices, including to select among alternative routes or alternative destinations <span class="citation">(Dios Ortúzar and Willumsen <a href="#ref-de2011modelling" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>When applied to destination choice, discrete choice models estimate the likelihood of selecting a particular destination among a set of alternatives based on the relative attractiveness, or <em>utility</em>, of each alternative. Utility may be function of distance or travel time alone (in which case, a utility-based accessibility measure might be quite similar to a location-based measure), but it can also incorporate other destination characteristics that lead one destination to be more highly-utilized than another. For a utility-based measure of park accessibility, these might include park size or park amenities.</p>
<p>Destination-choice models have not commonly been used to measure park accessibility, but there is recognition that park accessibility metrics should in some way be linked with park use. After all, a park that has many visitors must by definition be accessible to those visitors. <span class="citation">McCormack et al. (<a href="#ref-McCormack2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> provide a comprehensive review of this literature; it is sufficient here to note that most studies find a complicated interplay between park size, maintenance, facilities, and travel distance. Many of these attributes are incorporated into ParkIndex <span class="citation">(Kaczynski et al. <a href="#ref-Kaczynski2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>, which estimates the resident park use potential within <span class="math inline">\(100 m^2\)</span> grid cells, based on a household park use survey in Kansas City.</p>
<p>The park use potential measured by ParkIndex is not dissimilar from a park trip production potential, as used by transportation planners and engineers. Along these lines, the question of park use is a destination choice problem, where trip makers consider which park is most attractive to accomplish their recreation activity. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-ite2019" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> contains trip attraction rates for public parks that use the park acreage, number of picnic tables, employees, and other variables as attraction terms. As with many land uses in Trip Generation, the provided trip generation rates are based on a limited number of observational samples <span class="citation">(Shoup <a href="#ref-shoup_truth_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span> and may not represent large-sample behavior <span class="citation">(Millard-Ball <a href="#ref-Millard-Ball2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. Moreover, regression-based attraction rates isolated from trip production and travel behavior ignore the geographical and behavioral contexts in which people actually make trips to parks <span class="citation">(Barnard and Brindle <a href="#ref-Barnard1987" role="doc-biblioref">1987</a>)</span>: Though more people may come to larger parks, a park cannot attract more people simply by becoming bigger.</p>
<p>There are limited examples of researchers using a destination choice model to predict recreation attractions. <span class="citation">Kinnell et al. (<a href="#ref-Kinnell2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span> apply a choice model to a survey of park visitors in New Jersey, and estimate the relative attractiveness of park attributes including playgrounds, picnic areas, and park acreage weighed against the travel disutility and the relative crime rate at the destination. In a similar study, <span class="citation">Meyerhoff, Dehnhardt, and Hartje (<a href="#ref-Meyerhoff2010" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> model the urban swimming location choice for a surveyed sample. In both studies, the researchers were attempting to ascertain which attributes of a recreation generated the most positive utility, and therefore which attributes should be prioritized for improvement. These studies have not to our knowledge been previously referenced in discussions of park accessibility.</p>
<p>One obstacle to estimating discrete-choice models to estimate park choice has been the lack of sufficiently detailed, trip-level data. The advent of large-scale mobile networks and the seemingly perpetual association of unique devices with unique users has given researchers a new opportunity to observe the movements and activity location patterns for large subsets of the population <span class="citation">(Naboulsi et al. <a href="#ref-Naboulsi2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. Such passively collected movement data — sometimes referred to as “Big Data” — is a by-product of other systems including cellular call data records <span class="citation">(e.g., Bolla and Davoli <a href="#ref-Bolla2000" role="doc-biblioref">2000</a>; Calabrese et al. <a href="#ref-Calabrese2011" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span>, probe GPS data <span class="citation">(Huang and Levinson <a href="#ref-Huang2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, and more recently Location Based Services (LBS) <span class="citation">(Roll <a href="#ref-Roll2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; Komanduri et al. <a href="#ref-Komanduri2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. LBS use a network of mobile applications that obtain the users’ physical location. A variety of commercial vendors repackage, clean, and scale these data to population or traffic targets and sell origin-destination matrices to researchers and practitioners at relatively low prices. <span class="citation">Monz et al. (<a href="#ref-Monz2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, for example, demonstrate how passive device data can be used to accurately estimate trips to natural
recreation areas.</p>
<p>Passive origin-destination matrices are beginning to inform trip distribution model development more directly as well. <span class="citation">Kressner (<a href="#ref-tf_idea" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> proposes one methodology, where passive origin-destination matrices serve as a probabilistic sampling frame for a simulated trip destination choice. <span class="citation">Bernardin et al. (<a href="#ref-Bernardin2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> employ a passive origin-destination matrix as a shadow price reference in an activity-based location choice model, iteratively adjusting the parameters of the choice utilities to minimize the observed error between the matrix and the modeled predictions. A similar method developed by <span class="citation">Zhu and Ye (<a href="#ref-Zhu2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> uses the passive dataset directly, sampling 10,000 random trips from GPS traces of taxi trips in Shanghai
and estimating a destination choice model. Employing the passive data set in this way provides the authors an opportunity to examine the choices of a large sample of a small population (taxi passengers) as well as sufficient data to estimate a “constants-rich” destination choice model with uniquely estimated coefficients for each origin-destination pair. The <span class="citation">Zhu and Ye (<a href="#ref-Zhu2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span> methodology suggests that a similar approach should apply in other contexts, including park choice. Applying these models to park choice allows us to not only predict potential park use, but also determine which park characteristics are most valuable to particular populations. The results of such an analysis offer an important complement to existing qualitative research on park use by marginalized populations.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Byrne (<a href="#ref-byrne2012green" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span> applies a cultural politics theoretical frame to why people of color are underrepresented among visitors to some urban parks. Focus groups of Latino residents emphasized the importance of parks to children and childhood. Participants described visiting parks with their children and the positive and negatives associations that parks evoked of their own childhood memories of parks and wilderness. Participants described barriers to visiting parks including distance, inadequate or poorly maintained facilities, and fear of crime. Participants also expressed that they did not feel welcome in parks located in high-income or predominantly white neighborhoods, either because they expected that other park users would have racist attitudes, or because they expected that a more boisterous Latino ‘recreational style’ would not be tolerated or that there would be other behavioral norms they were not aware of. They cited a lack of Spanish-language signage not only as a barrier to understanding but also as a signal that a park was not intended to serve Spanish speakers.</p>
