We applied a Yeo-Johnson transformation (Yeo and Johnson 2000) to both distance and acreage; the Yeo-Johnson transformation replicates the constant marginal elasticity of a logarithmic transformation while avoiding undefined values (\\(YJ(0) = 0\\)). For simplicity, we call this transformation log() in the model results tables. Using a constant marginal elasticity is better reflective of how people perceive distances and sizes; a one-mile increase to a trip distance is more impactful to a one-mile trip than a ten-mile trip. base_models &lt;- list( &quot;Network Distance&quot; = mlogit( chosen ~ yj_distance + yj_acres | -1 , data = estim), &quot;Park Attributes&quot; = mlogit( chosen ~ yj_distance + yj_acres + playground + trail + pitch | -1 , data = estim), &quot;Sport Detail&quot; = mlogit( chosen ~ yj_distance + yj_acres + playground + baseball + basketball + `football / soccer` + other_pitch + volleyball + tennis + trail | -1 , data = estim) ) detail_lrt &lt;- lrtest(base_models[[2]], base_models[[3]])$`Pr(&gt;Chisq)`[2] d_ratio_base &lt;- -1 * coefficients(base_models$`Network Distance`)[1] / coefficients(base_models$`Network Distance`)[2] d_ratio_sport &lt;- -1 * coefficients(base_models$`Sport Detail`)[1] / coefficients(base_models$`Sport Detail`)[2] Table 4.1 presents the model estimation results for a series of models with different utility function definitions, each estimated on the complete set of synthetic choice makers. The first model — named “Network Distance” — only considers the distance to the park and the size of the park in the utility equation. The estimated coefficients are significant and of the expected sign: That is, individuals will travel further distances to reach larger parks. The ratio of the estimated coefficients implies that on average, people will travel 3.3089752 times further to reach a park twice as large. The second and third models in Table 4.1 include a vector of park attributes. In the model labeled “Park Attributes,” the presence of any sport field is considered with a single dummy value, and in the “Sport Detail” model this variable is disaggregated into facilities for different sports. The value of the size and distance coefficients change modestly from the “Network Distance” model, with the implied size to distance trade-off rising to 3.3089752. Examining the two amenities models — independently and in comparison with each other — reveals a few surprising findings. First, it appears that playgrounds and sport fields in general contribute negatively to the choice utility equation. This is both unintuitive and contradictory to previous findings in this space (e.g., Kinnell et al. 2006). Considering different sports separately, there is a wide variety of observed response with tennis and volleyball facilities attracting more trips, and football and basketball facilities attracting fewer, all else equal. Trails and walking paths give substantive positive utility in both models. The difference in likelihood statistics between the three models is significant (likelihood ratio test \\(p\\)-value 1.804975210^{-4}), and so in spite of the curious aggregate findings, we move forward with this utility specification. modelsummary( base_models, stars = TRUE, output = &quot;kableExtra&quot;, coef_map = this_map, gof_omit = &quot;BIC&quot;, title = &quot;Estimated Model Coefficients&quot; ) %&gt;% scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, box_css = &quot;border: 0px;&quot;) Table 4.1: Estimated Model Coefficients Network Distance Park Attributes Sport Detail log(Distance) -1.354*** -1.394*** -1.390*** (0.022) (0.022) (0.022) log(Acres) 0.409*** 0.353*** 0.348*** (0.011) (0.012) (0.012) Playground -0.437*** -0.551*** (0.049) (0.049) Trail 0.555*** 0.564*** (0.052) (0.053) Sport Field -0.324*** (0.050) Basketball -0.232*** (0.068) Baseball 0.067 (0.067) Football / Soccer -0.481*** (0.095) Tennis 0.236*** (0.066) Volleyball 0.615*** (0.135) Other Sport -0.191** (0.090) Num.Obs. 3971 3971 3971 AIC 11600.2 11306.5 11292.1 Log.Lik. -5798.103 -5648.236 -5636.028 rho2 rho20 0.391 0.407 0.408 * p &lt; 0.1, ** p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.01 minority_models &lt;- estim %&gt;% mutate(group = case_when( black &gt; 30 ~ &quot;black&quot;, asian &gt; 30 ~ &quot;asian&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;other&quot; )) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(group)) %&gt;% group_by(group) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate( data = map(data, logit_converter), mnl = map(data, group_mnl) ) income_models &lt;- estim %&gt;% mutate(group = case_when(lowincome &gt; 30 ~ &quot;lowincome&quot;, highincome &gt; 50 ~ &quot;highincome&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;other&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(group)) %&gt;% group_by(group) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate( data = map(data, logit_converter), mnl = map(data, group_mnl) ) child_models &lt;- estim %&gt;% mutate(group = case_when(children &gt; 25 ~ &quot;children&quot;, children &lt; 5 ~ &quot;few children&quot;, TRUE ~ &quot;other&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(group)) %&gt;% group_by(group) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate( data = map(data, logit_converter), mnl = map(data, group_mnl) ) models &lt;- list( &quot;&gt; 30% Asian&quot; = minority_models$mnl[[1]], &quot;&gt; 30% Black&quot; = minority_models$mnl[[3]], &quot;Other&quot; = minority_models$mnl[[2]], &quot;&gt; 30% Low income&quot; = income_models$mnl[[1]], &quot;&gt; 50% High income&quot; = income_models$mnl[[3]], &quot;Other&quot; = income_models$mnl[[2]], &quot;&gt; 25% children&quot; = child_models$mnl[[3]], &quot;&lt; 5% children&quot; = child_models$mnl[[2]], &quot;Other&quot; = child_models$mnl[[1]] ) It is worth investigating the heterogeneity in preferences that exist among different demographic groups. Though the income and ethnicity of the synthetic park visitors is not known, we can segment the estimation dataset based on the socioeconomic makeup of the visitors’ residence block group. The models presented in Table 4.2 were estimated on segments developed in this manner. Models under the “Minority” heading include a race-based segmentation: simulated individuals living in block groups with more than thirty percent Black persons are included in the “&gt;30% Black” model, an analogous segmentation for block groups with high Asian populations are in the “&gt;30% Asian” model, and the “Other” model contains all other block groups. Another set of model segmentation relies on the share of the population in each block group with household incomes above or below certain thresholds. Again, we use the threshold definitions based on in ??. modelsummary( models, stars = TRUE, output = &quot;kableExtra&quot;, coef_map = this_map, gof_omit = &quot;BIC&quot;, title = &quot;Estimated Model Coefficients with Block Group Segmentations&quot; ) %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot; = 1, &quot;Minority&quot; = 3, &quot;Income&quot; = 3, &quot;Children&quot; = 3)) %&gt;% scroll_box(width = &quot;100%&quot;, box_css = &quot;border: 0px;&quot;) Table 4.2: Estimated Model Coefficients with Block Group Segmentations Minority Income Children &gt; 30% Asian &gt; 30% Black Other &gt; 30% Low income &gt; 50% High income Other &gt; 25% children &lt; 5% children Other log(Distance) -1.329*** -1.523*** -1.377*** -1.419*** -1.310*** -1.395*** -1.235*** -1.595*** -1.398*** (0.038) (0.064) (0.031) (0.051) (0.051) (0.029) (0.059) (0.083) (0.026) log(Acres) 0.373*** 0.306*** 0.342*** 0.334*** 0.345*** 0.354*** 0.316*** 0.371*** 0.355*** (0.020) (0.032) (0.017) (0.027) (0.028) (0.015) (0.030) (0.043) (0.014) Playground -0.519*** -0.390*** -0.631*** -0.525*** -0.493*** -0.585*** -0.425*** -0.886*** -0.542*** (0.085) (0.121) (0.070) (0.104) (0.122) (0.063) (0.123) (0.179) (0.056) Trail 0.658*** 0.359*** 0.639*** 0.305*** 0.897*** 0.613*** 0.121 0.744*** 0.638*** (0.095) (0.128) (0.076) (0.109) (0.148) (0.068) (0.126) (0.191) (0.062) Basketball -0.009 -0.346* -0.414*** -0.172 -0.110 -0.294*** -0.322* -0.289 -0.208*** (0.109) (0.184) (0.102) (0.153) (0.160) (0.088) (0.172) (0.262) (0.078) Baseball 0.128 0.172 -0.025 0.026 -0.104 0.132 0.140 -0.070 0.074 (0.111) (0.172) (0.097) (0.146) (0.164) (0.085) (0.168) (0.254) (0.076) Football / Soccer -0.473*** -1.060*** -0.348** -0.866*** -0.249 -0.443*** -0.168 -0.941*** -0.527*** (0.154) (0.283) (0.138) (0.226) (0.223) (0.120) (0.229) (0.356) (0.110) Tennis 0.388*** -0.518** 0.322*** -0.080 0.661*** 0.207** 0.344** -0.038 0.237*** (0.108) (0.210) (0.095) (0.163) (0.146) (0.085) (0.163) (0.264) (0.076) Volleyball 0.709*** -0.077 0.460** 0.435 0.454* 0.604*** 0.552* 0.446 0.617*** (0.197) (0.615) (0.212) (0.403) (0.257) (0.177) (0.329) (0.537) (0.154) Other Sport -0.082 -0.396 -0.251* -0.492** -0.069 -0.178 0.252 -0.540 -0.265** (0.145) (0.270) (0.132) (0.234) (0.188) (0.117) (0.218) (0.355) (0.104) Num.Obs. 1365 579 2027 777 758 2436 544 358 3069 AIC 3938.8 1738.7 5560.5 2396.8 1908.7 6974.1 1810.8 894.5 8572.7 Log.Lik. -1959.423 -859.375 -2770.253 -1188.423 -944.365 -3477.025 -895.408 -437.255 -4276.373 rho2 rho20 0.401 0.381 0.430 0.362 0.480 0.405 0.314 0.491 0.419 * p &lt; 0.1, ** p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.01 The model estimates in Table 4.2 reveal that there is noticeable heterogeneity in the response among different socioeconomic groups. Park visitors living in block groups with a high proportion of Black and low-income residents show less affinity for trails and other walkways, but appear are also considerably to be more sensitive to the distance of a park. Visitors living in high-income neighborhoods are more attracted to the amenities of a park, or rather these visitors do not show significant negative coefficients for amenities, e.g. basketball courts and football fields. # write a function to estimate multiple MNL models on different # segments of the estimation data estimate_split_models &lt;- function(data, var, splits) { lapply(splits, function(p){ data %&gt;% filter(.data[[var]] &gt; p) %&gt;% tibble() %&gt;% mutate(share = p) }) %&gt;% bind_rows() %&gt;% group_by(share) %&gt;% nest() %&gt;% mutate( data = map(data, logit_converter), mnl = map(data, group_mnl), coef = map(mnl, tidy) ) } splits &lt;- c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40) split_models &lt;- lapply(c(&quot;black&quot;, &quot;asian&quot;, &quot;lowincome&quot;, &quot;highincome&quot;, &quot;children&quot;), function(var) { estimate_split_models(estim, var, splits) %&gt;% mutate(Segmentation = var) }) %&gt;% bind_rows() Seeing that there is a difference in the response in the model segmentation, it is also worth considering the role of our segmentation thresholds in these findings. Figure 4.1 shows the estimated coefficients and confidence intervals for these different amenities at different threshold levels of segmentation. The threshold level means that at least that percent of the block group’s population falls in that category. The confidence intervals widen as more observations are excluded from the model. The estimated coefficients for the different segmentations are identical when the share equals zero, and simply represent the “Sport Detail” model from Table 4.1. Overall, increasing the segmentation threshold level reveals some additional information about user preferences. First, it should be noted that there is some inconsistency: for instance, block groups with at least 40% of low income households show a lower importance of distance than block groups with either 30% or 50% low income households. The increasing width of the confidence interval, however, means it is difficult to make generalized statements. Residents of block groups with a higher share of Asian or high income households both show relatively more affinity for tennis courts and trails. Block groups with high Black populations show a somewhat greater preference for playgrounds, as well appearing to be the most distance-sensitive group. # extract the coefficients you need to plot dat &lt;- modelplot(split_models$mnl %&gt;% setNames(str_c(split_models$Segmentation, split_models$share, sep = &quot;_&quot;)), coef_map = this_map, draw = FALSE) %&gt;% separate(model, into = c(&quot;Segmentation&quot;, &quot;share&quot;), convert = TRUE, sep = &quot;_&quot;) %&gt;% mutate( Segmentation = case_when( Segmentation == &quot;black&quot; ~ &quot;Black&quot;, Segmentation == &quot;asian&quot; ~ &quot;Asian&quot;, Segmentation == &quot;lowincome&quot; ~ &quot;Income &lt; $35k&quot;, Segmentation == &quot;highincome&quot; ~ &quot;Income &gt; $125k&quot;, Segmentation == &quot;children&quot; ~ &quot;Children under 6&quot; ) ) # make the plot these_colors &lt;- wesanderson::wes_palettes$Darjeeling1 split_plots &lt;- ggplot(dat, aes(x = share, y = estimate, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high, color = Segmentation, fill = Segmentation)) + theme_minimal() + geom_line() + geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.05, size = 0.1, lty = &quot;dotted&quot;) + facet_wrap(~ fct_rev(term), scales = &quot;free_y&quot;, ncol = 3) + scale_color_manual(values = these_colors) + scale_fill_manual(values = these_colors) + xlab(&quot;Percent of Block Group Population&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Estimated coefficient and 95% confidence interval&quot;) if(knitr::is_latex_output()) { lemon::reposition_legend(split_plots, position = &#39;top left&#39;, panel = &quot;panel-3-4&quot;) } else { plotly::ggplotly(split_plots) } ## Warning: `group_by_()` is deprecated as of dplyr 0.7.0. ## Please use `group_by()` instead. ## See vignette(&#39;programming&#39;) for more help ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated. Figure 4.1: Estimated utility coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for park amenities at different socioeconomic threshold levels. 4.1 Model Application In spring and summer 2020, cities across the world responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by converting city streets into temporary pedestrian plazas. The stated goals of this policy included providing recreational space that would allow people to walk and exercise outside with sufficient personal space and less risk of conflict from vehicle traffic. This policy created several dozen temporary open spaces in urbanized areas of the county. In this section, we apply the models estimated above to evaluate the benefits of this policy in terms of aggregate value, as well as the equity of the policy with respect to different income and ethnic groups. attributed_parks &lt;- read_rds(&quot;data/attributed_parks.rds&quot;) slowstreets &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/slow_streets.geojson&quot;) %&gt;% st_transform(this_crs) ## Reading layer `slow_streets&#39; from data source `/Users/gregmacfarlane/projects/alameda_destinationchoice/data/slow_streets.geojson&#39; using driver `GeoJSON&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 74 features and 8 fields ## geometry type: MULTILINESTRING ## dimension: XY ## bbox: xmin: -13614010 ymin: 4542899 xmax: -13599190 ymax: 4561117 ## CRS: 3857 street_parks &lt;- slowstreets %&gt;% st_buffer(dist = 25) %&gt;% # 50 foot wide park ( 4 lanes of traffic) mutate(acres = as.numeric(st_area(.)) / 43560) %&gt;% mutate() %&gt;% transmute( id = str_c(&quot;st&quot;, ID), access = &quot;Open Access&quot;, acres, type = &quot;Street&quot;, yj_acres = VGAM::yeo.johnson(acres, lambda = 0), playground = FALSE, baseball = FALSE, basketball = FALSE, `football / soccer` = FALSE, other_pitch = FALSE, volleyball = FALSE, tennis = FALSE, pitch = FALSE, trail = TRUE, attractions = NA ) We obtained the list of streets in Alameda County that were reported closed in the “Shifting Streets” COVID-19 mobility dataset (Combs et al. 2020). This dataset reports that 74 individual streets were closed to vehicle traffic (and thereby opened as public spaces); these streets represent 27.5730459 total miles across the cities of Berkeley, Oakland, and Alameda. For the purposes of this analysis, we represent each closed street as a single “park” without any sport facilities or playgrounds, but with a trail / walking path. The database provides the closed streets as polyline objects; we assert a 25-foot buffer around the line to represent a polygon with a measurable area. Finally, we measure the network-based distance from each population-weighted block group centroid to the nearest boundary of each closed park. # distances computed in py/shortest_paths.py path_files &lt;- dir(&quot;data/streets/&quot;, full.names = TRUE) street_distances &lt;- lapply(path_files, function(file) { read_csv(file, col_types = list(geoid = col_character(), park_id = col_character())) %&gt;% mutate( yj_distance = VGAM::yeo.johnson(distance, lambda = 0), yj_euc_dist = VGAM::yeo.johnson(euc_dist, lambda = 0) ) }) %&gt;% bind_rows() %&gt;% rename(home = geoid, park = park_id) %&gt;% mutate(home = sprintf(&quot;%012s&quot;, home)) # read data on streets and distances distance_df &lt;- read_rds(&quot;data/distances.rds&quot;) attributed_parks &lt;- read_rds(&quot;data/attributed_parks.rds&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(chosen = FALSE) %&gt;% ungroup() attributed_parks$chosen[55] &lt;- TRUE # create base situation prediction dataset base_choices &lt;- distance_df %&gt;% left_join(attributed_parks, by = c(&quot;park&quot; = &quot;id&quot;)) %&gt;% rename(id = home, alt = park) %&gt;% logit_converter() # create streets situation prediction dataset, augmented by street parks street_choices &lt;- left_join( bind_rows(street_distances, distance_df), bind_rows(street_parks %&gt;% mutate(chosen = FALSE, attractions = FALSE), attributed_parks), by = c(&quot;park&quot; = &quot;id&quot;)) %&gt;% rename(id = home, alt = park) %&gt;% logit_converter() Using this new dataset — augmented with parks added by street openings — we applied the “Sport Detail” non-segmented model to calculate park choice utilities and utility-based accessibility values for each block group in Alameda County. As discussed in Section 3.2, the difference in accessibility values provides a means to evaluate the benefit of the policy in a By comparing the difference in accessibility valuation with and without the street “parks” we can evaluate the monetary benefit of the policy. The dataset used for this research does not have any information on travel costs or entrance fees, and such data would likely not be relevant in the context of urban parks. As a result, there is no direct link between the utility and a monetary cost in this model directly. As a substitution, the regional travel model employed by MTC (the MPO) uses a cost coefficient of \\(-0.6\\) divided by the simulated agents’s value of time to determine destination choices for non-work trips.1 This value of time varies by the agent’s income, but using the population median value of $7.75 per hour results in a cost coefficient on the destination choice utility of \\(-0.215\\). Dividing the difference in accessibility logsums by the negative of this value can provide an initial estimate of the monetary value of the policy to each park user. logsums &lt;- lapply(list(&quot;Base&quot; = base_choices, &quot;Streets&quot; = street_choices), function(df){ u &lt;- predict(base_models$`Sport Detail`, newdata = df, type = &quot;linpred&quot;) logsum &lt;- log(rowSums(exp(u))) list( u = u, logsum = logsum ) }) logsums_tibble &lt;- tibble( geoid = names(logsums$Base$logsum), base = logsums$Base$logsum, streets = logsums$Streets$logsum ) blockgroups &lt;- read_rds(&quot;data/blockgroups.rds&quot;) %&gt;% left_join(logsums_tibble, by = &quot;geoid&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(diff_ls = (streets - base) / 0.215) Figure 4.2 presents this monetary valuation spatially. Unsurprisingly, the benefits are concentrated in the block groups surrounding the opened streets. Most residents of central Oakland see a benefit of somewhere around $1, while some zones see an equivalent benefit of as much as $30. There is some benefit assigned just for having more options, though this is small and on the order of 10 cents for most block groups away from where the street openings occured. diff_pal &lt;- colorBin( palette = as.character(wesanderson::wes_palette(&quot;Zissou1&quot;)), domain = blockgroups$diff_ls, #bins = quantile(blockgroups$diff_ls, probs = c(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 1)) bins = c(0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 10, 35) ) leaflet(data = blockgroups %&gt;% st_transform(4326)) %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldGrayCanvas) %&gt;% addPolygons(fillColor = ~diff_pal(diff_ls), stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 1) %&gt;% addPolylines(data = slowstreets %&gt;% st_transform(4326), color = &quot;green&quot;) %&gt;% addLegend(&quot;bottomleft&quot;, pal = diff_pal, values = ~diff_ls, title = &quot;Value of Street Opening&quot;) Figure 4.2: Monetary value of street opening to residents based on utility change.

Geurs and van Wee (2004) classify cumulative opportunity and gravity-based measures into a single category that they refer to as location-based measures. Researchers have applied versions of location-based measures and, to a lesser degree, utility-based measures to quantify park accessibility 2.1.1 Location-based measures of park accessibility Cumulative opportunity measures are calculated by counting the number of origins or destinations within a threshold travel cost of a location (where cost might be some combination of distance, travel time, and/or monetary cost of travel). A strength of cumulative opportunity measures lies in their simplicity and intuitive interpretation. However, they may be too simple, especially with regard to trip costs near the threshold. An example of a cumulative opportunity measure might be the number of parks within a ten-minute walk of a person’s home, or the number of households living within ten minutes of a park. This measure would imply that a household living immediately adjacent to a park has the same access to it as one that lives nine minutes away, but that a household living eleven minutes away has no access to it. ParkScore (Trust for Public Land 2019), developed by the Trust for Public Land, is a popular measure of park accessibility that starts from a cumulative opportunity measure (the share of the population that resides within a 10-minute walk of a green space) and adjusts this value based on the total city green space, investment, and amenities weighted against the socioeconomic characteristics of the population outside of the 10-minute walk threshold. The resulting score is a convenient quantitative tool in estimating the relative quality of green space access across cities (Rigolon, Browning, and Jennings 2018). It may be less useful at identifying the comparative quality of access within a city, particularly since more than 95% of residents in many dense metropolitan areas like San Francisco and New York may live within the binary 10-minute walk threshold [citation needed]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed an “Accessibility to Parks Indicator” along similar lines (Ussery et al. 2016), calculating the share of the population living within a half-mile of a park for each county in the U.S. Gravity-based accessibility measures take a similar approach to cumulative opportunity measures, but theoretically include all possible destinations and weight them according to the travel cost that they impose, based on an impedance function. Cumulative opportunity measures may be considered a special case of gravity-based measures, where the impedance function takes the form of a binary step function that equals zero after a cutoff travel cost (which is why Geurs and van Wee (2004) classify them both as location-based). The inverse square function is a common form of impedance function for gravity-based accessibility measures. A major advantage of gravity-based accessibility measures lies in their consistency with travel behavior theory: Gravity-based measures have their roots in the trip-distribution step of the traditional four-step travel demand forecasting method, where trips originating in a particular zone are distributed among destination zones, proportionate to each zone’s gravity-based accessibility. Urban scholars have used gravity-based measures to explore the spatial distribution of park access across Tainan City, Taiwan (Chang and Liao 2011) and to estimate the relationship between park access and housing prices in Shenzhen, China (Wu et al. 2017). Some scholars have used location-based measures of park accessibility to evaluate equity in park access. Chang and Liao (2011) use a gravity-based measure to determine that low-income neighborhoods have less access to parks than higher-income neighborhoods in Tainan City, Taiwan. Bruton and Floyd (2014) conduct a neighborhood-level analysis of park amenities in Greensboro, North Carolina, and find that low-income neighborhoods tend to have parks with more picnic areas, more trash cans, and fewer wooded areas, but they do not address the question of the extent to which different populations might value these different amenities. Kabisch and Haase (2014) find that neighborhoods in Berlin with high immigrant populations and older populations likewise had less access to parks, and they pair these findings with survey results suggesting that these disparities are not consistent with the preferences expressed by those populations. The question of whether uneven distribution of parks and park amenities might reflect local preferences could be more appropriately addressed using utility-based measures of park accessibility (as discussed below) and though qualitative studies (as discussed in the following section). 2.1.2 Utility-based measures of park accessibility While traditional four-step travel demand models distribute zonal trips based on a gravity-based accessibility model, the travel demand modeling profession has shifted more recently towards activity-based models that distribute trips based on discrete-choice regression models. McFadden (1974) first applied discrete choice models to urban travel demand to predict mode choice, and activity-based models apply them to all travel behavior choices, including to select among alternative routes or alternative destinations (Dios Ortúzar and Willumsen 2011). When applied to destination choice, discrete choice models estimate the likelihood of selecting a particular destination among a set of alternatives based on the relative attractiveness, or utility, of each alternative. Utility may be function of distance or travel time alone (in which case, a utility-based accessibility measure might be quite similar to a location-based measure), but it can also incorporate other destination characteristics that lead one destination to be more highly-utilized than another. For a utility-based measure of park accessibility, these might include park size or park amenities. Destination-choice models have not commonly been used to measure park accessibility, scholars have acknowledged that park accessibility metrics should be linked with park use, since a park that has many visitors must by definition be accessible to those visitors. McCormack et al. (2010) provide a comprehensive review of this literature; it is sufficient here to note that most studies find park use to depend on a complicated interplay between park size, maintenance, facilities, and travel distance. Many of these attributes are incorporated into ParkIndex (Kaczynski et al. 2016), which estimates the resident park use potential within \\(100 m^2\\) grid cells, based on a household park use survey in Kansas City. The park use potential measured by ParkIndex is not dissimilar from a park trip production potential, as used by transportation planners and engineers. Along these lines, the question of park use is a destination choice problem, where trip makers consider which park is most attractive to accomplish their recreation activity. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual (2017) contains trip attraction rates for public parks that use the park acreage, number of picnic tables, employees, and other variables as attraction terms. As with many land uses in Trip Generation, the provided trip generation rates are based on a limited number of observational samples (Shoup 2003) and may not represent large-sample behavior (Millard-Ball 2015). Moreover, regression-based attraction rates isolated from trip production and travel behavior ignore the geographical and behavioral contexts in which people actually make trips to parks (Barnard and Brindle 1987): Though more people may come to larger parks, planners cannot bring more people to a park simply by increasing its size. There are limited examples of researchers using a destination choice model to predict recreation attractions. Kinnell et al. (2006) apply a choice model to a survey of park visitors in New Jersey, and estimate the relative attractiveness of park attributes including playgrounds, picnic areas, and park acreage weighed against the travel disutility and the relative crime rate at the destination. In a similar study, Meyerhoff, Dehnhardt, and Hartje (2010) model the urban swimming location choice for a surveyed sample. In both studies, the researchers were attempting to ascertain which attributes of a recreation generated the most positive utility, and therefore which attributes should be prioritized for improvement. These studies have not to our knowledge been previously referenced in discussions of park accessibility. One obstacle to estimating discrete-choice models to estimate park choice has been the lack of sufficiently detailed, trip-level data. The advent of large-scale mobile networks and the seemingly perpetual association of unique devices with unique users has given researchers a new opportunity to observe the movements and activity location patterns for large subsets of the population (Naboulsi et al. 2016). Such passively collected movement data — sometimes referred to as “Big Data” — is a by-product of other systems including cellular call data records (e.g., Bolla and Davoli 2000; Calabrese et al. 2011), probe GPS data (Huang and Levinson 2015), and more recently Location Based Services (LBS) (Roll 2019; Komanduri et al. 2017). LBS use a network of mobile applications that obtain the users’ physical location. A variety of commercial vendors repackage, clean, and scale these data to population or traffic targets and sell origin-destination matrices to researchers and practitioners at relatively low prices. Monz et al. (2019), for example, demonstrate how passive device data can be used to accurately estimate trips to natural recreation areas. Passive origin-destination matrices are beginning to inform trip distribution model development more directly as well. Kressner (2017) proposes one methodology, where passive origin-destination matrices serve as a probabilistic sampling frame for a simulated trip destination choice. Bernardin et al. (2018) employ a passive origin-destination matrix as a shadow price reference in an activity-based location choice model, iteratively adjusting the parameters of the choice utilities to minimize the observed error between the matrix and the modeled predictions. A similar method developed by Zhu and Ye (2018) uses the passive dataset directly, sampling 10,000 random trips from GPS traces of taxi trips in Shanghai and estimating a destination choice model. Employing the passive data set in this way provides the authors an opportunity to examine the choices of a large sample of a small population (taxi passengers) as well as sufficient data to estimate a “constants-rich” destination choice model with uniquely estimated coefficients for each origin-destination pair. The Zhu and Ye (2018) methodology suggests that a similar approach should apply in other contexts, including park choice. Applying these models to park choice allows us to not only predict potential park use, but also determine which park characteristics are most valuable to particular populations. The results of such an analysis offer an important complement to existing qualitative and survey-based research on park use by marginalized populations. 2.2 Sociodemographic variation in park utility The idea that different racial, ethnic, or cultural groups have different recreational styles, and might thus have different needs and preferences for parks and open space, has been thoroughly discussed in the leisure studies literature, and Husbands and Idahosa (1995) offer a detailed review of that research as of the mid-1990s. In general, explanations for racial and ethnic differences in park use can be classified into two categories: those rooted in cultural and lifestyle differences, and those rooted in discrimination and marginalization. Byrne and Wolch (2009) summarize literature in the former category, noting that African Americans have been described as preferring more social, sports-oriented spaces, relative to white people who prefer secluded natural settings (Washburne 1978; Hutchison 1987; Floyd and Shinew 1999; Gobster 2002; Payne, Mowen, and Orsega-Smith 2002; Ho et al. 2005); Asians are described as valuing aesthetics over recreational spaces; (Gobster 2002; Payne, Mowen, and Orsega-Smith 2002; Ho et al. 2005), and Latinos are said to value group-oriented amenities like picnic tables and restrooms (Baas, Ewert, and Chavez 1993; Hutchison 1987; Irwin, Gartner, and Phelps 1990). Byrne and Wolch (2009) criticize such scholarship as having grossly exaggerated ethno-racial differences in park use and preferences, and suggest a model for explaining park use based on four elements: Sociodemographic characteristics; park amenities and surrounding land uses; historical/cultural context of park provision (including development politics and discriminatory land-use policies); and individual perceptions of park space (including safety and sense of welcome). Byrne (2012) applies a cultural politics theoretical frame to why people of color are underrepresented among visitors to some urban parks. Focus groups of Latino residents emphasized the importance of parks to children and childhood. Participants described visiting parks with their children and the positive and negatives associations that parks evoked of their own childhood memories of parks and wilderness. Participants described barriers to visiting parks including distance, inadequate or poorly maintained facilities, and fear of crime. They cited a lack of Spanish-language signage not only as a barrier to understanding but also as a signal that a park was not intended to serve Spanish speakers. Participants also expressed that they did not feel welcome in parks located in high-income or predominantly white neighborhoods, either because they expected that other park users would have racist attitudes, or because they expected that a more boisterous Latino ‘recreational style’ would not be tolerated or that there would be other behavioral norms they were not aware of. In an observational and survey-based study of park users in Los Angeles, Loukaitou-Sideris (1995) found a high-level of enthusiasm for park use among Hispanic people. While she found, consistent with prior research (Baas, Ewert, and Chavez 1993; Hutchison 1987; Irwin, Gartner, and Phelps 1990), that Hispanic park users showed a preference for passive recreation, she found that to be the case for all other user groups as well. She also found that Hispanic park users were the most likely to actively appropriate and modify park space, for example, by bringing items from home. She found that Hispanic park users tended to visit parks as family groups; African American park users tended to visit parks as peer groups; Caucasian park users tended to visit parks alone; and Asian residents were least likely to visit parks, even in a predominantly Asian neighborhood. Interviews with local elderly Asian residents (Chinese immigrants) suggested that a lack of interest in American parks was rooted in perceptions of the ideal park as “an aesthetic element of gorgeous design,” leaving them unimpressed with poorly landscaped American parks emphasizing recreational functions. 2.3 Changing park systems in response to a global pandemic [placeholder for literature on COVID shifting streets - will draw heavily from Tab Combs’ working paper] The definition of an urban park is not well-established, though some might echo Justice Potter Stewart in arguing that we know one when we see one (“Jacobellis V. Ohio” 1964). If we define an urban park as a public space that is designated for the purpose of recreation, exercise, and social gathering, then the rapid reallocation of street space that occurred in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 and 2020 could be characterized as a proliferation of small urban parks. During that same period, many municipalities closed specific park amenities including playgrounds and restrooms. How might these combined actions have changed the distribution of park utility, benefits, or access among different populations of park users? References "]
