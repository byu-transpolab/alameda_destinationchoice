A key aspect of accessibility to parks is the distance between parks and
neighborhoods. There are two different ways to calculate distance:

   - *Euclidean* distances use the straight-line distance between two points.
   - *Network* distances use the path along a highway or sidewalk network.
  
Both measurements have limitations. Euclidean distances are particularly
problematic when there are rivers, interstates, or other impassible features that
substantially lengthen the distance people travel to get between points. On the
other hand, there is not lots of data suggesting that people perceive network 
travel times very well when they are choosing destinations. We originally
estimated the models for this paper with Euclidean distances, but
our reviewers suggested we examine network-based distances as well.

We will use the same parks dataset we assembled [previously](01_parks.Rmd).

```{r load}
parks <- read_rds(here("data/attributed_parks.rds"))
```

## Euclidean Distances

The geometric centroid of the tract / block group is not a good approximation of
the center point of the tract from an accessibility standpoint. Thus, we 
get the population-weighted centroid for block groups from Census.


```{r bg_centroids}
# California has state FIPS 06
bg_url <- "https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/reference/cenpop2010/blkgrp/CenPop2010_Mean_BG06.txt"

bg_centroids <- read_csv(bg_url) %>%
  # Alameda is county 001
  filter(COUNTYFP %in% c("001")) %>%
  transmute(geoid = str_c(STATEFP, COUNTYFP, TRACTCE, BLKGRPCE), LATITUDE, LONGITUDE) %>%
  # convert to sf and project into the feet-based projection used in the
  # parks dataset.
  st_as_sf(crs = 4326, coords = c("LONGITUDE", "LATITUDE")) %>%
  st_transform(this_crs) 
```


The `st_distance()` function from the `sf` library is able to compute the 
Euclidean distance between two sets of shapes, and gets the distance between 
points and edges of polygons directly. We calculate the distance in miles, 
and constrain that the minimum distance is 0.1 miles (no one lives in a park).

```{r distance_table}
distance_table <- function(points, poly){
  dists <- st_distance(points, poly, by_element = FALSE) %>%
    units::set_units(miles) %>%
    units::drop_units()
  
  dists <- pmax(dists, 0.1)
  
  rownames(dists) <- points$geoid
  colnames(dists) <- poly$id
  
  as_tibble(dists, rownames = "geoid") %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -geoid, names_to = "park_id", values_to = "distance")
}

dist_bg_euc <- distance_table(bg_centroids, parks)
```


```{r distances}
list("blockgroups" = dist_bg_euc) %>%
  write_rds(here("data/distances.rds"))
```

## Network Distances

To calculate network-based distances between block group / tract centroids and
park boundaries, we employ the `osmnx` library for Python. This is a relatively
new package that allows users to retrieve networks from OpenStreetMap and 
compute shortest paths using Python's other network libraries. We retrieve
a walk network for Alameda County, and re-project it to UTM zone 10N. An
image of this network is provided in Figure \@ref(fig:oakland-osm-network)

```py
graph = ox.graph_from_place("Alameda County, California", network_type='walk')
# project to UTM zone 10 N and simplify
graph_proj = ox.project_graph(graph)
graph_proj = nx.DiGraph(graph_proj)
```

```{r oakland-osm-network, fig.cap="OpenStreetMap walk network in Oakland, obtained through the `osmnx` pakcakge."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/oakland_osm_network.png"))
```


One limitation of the network calculation is that it only works for nodes on the
network, and we can only find nearest nodes to points. Thus we need to convert
the park polygons data into points. But we can't simply have an endless number
of points because the shortest path calculations are computationally extensive.

So to make this work, we first simplify the parks polygons, convert the boundaries
to linestrings, and then sample points along the linestring.

```{r park_points, eval = TRUE}
# get park boundary polygon
park_boundaries <- parks %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(id)  %>%
  
  # some polygons are way too detailed, so we want to simplify to 100 foot resolution
  st_simplify(dTolerance = 100, preserveTopology = TRUE) %>%
  
  # need to convert everything to multipolygons to get multiple rows per shape
  st_cast("MULTIPOLYGON") %>%
  
  st_cast("POLYGON") %>%
  # cast the polygons to a linestring of the park perimeter
  st_cast("LINESTRING", group_or_split = TRUE) 
point_samples <- park_boundaries %>%
  # sample points along the line, one point per 500 feet.
  st_line_sample(density = 1/500) 
# append open space id and coerce to single point per row
park_points <- st_sf(id = park_boundaries$id, geometry = point_samples)  %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  st_cast(to = "POINT")
```

We also need to do this for the closed streets.
```{r closed_street_points}
streets <- st_read(here("data/slow_streets.geojson")) 
street_bndy <- streets %>%
  st_transform(this_crs)  %>% ungroup() %>%
  transmute(id = str_c("st", ID))  %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING", group_or_split = TRUE)
street_sample <- st_line_sample(street_bndy, density = 1 / 500)
street_points <- st_sf(id = street_bndy$id, geometry = street_sample)  %>%
  st_as_sf() %>% st_cast(to = "POINT")
```


We can illustrate what this looks like. Every park has at least one sampled point,
and some have several. Unfortunately there's not a concave polygon function to help
us remove all the internal points from the parks.

```{r simplified-point-map, cache = FALSE}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldGrayCanvas) %>%
  addPolygons(data = parks %>% st_transform(4326), color = "green") %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data = park_points %>% st_transform(4326), radius = 0.001,
                   color = "red") 
```

With `r nrow(park_points)` and `r nrow(bg_centroids)`, that suggests we
need to compute `r nrow(park_points) * nrow(bg_centroids)` shortest
paths. Even on a 20+ core process, this would take a long time.  As a result,
we simplify the problem by first identifying the "closest" point of the park
by Euclidean distance and then computing the network path to that point.
This introduces some distortion where if the closest Euclidean point is across 
a river or interstate, the method calculates the network distance to *that*
point instead of the first point the person would encounter following the
network. This may end up overstating the true experienced distance.

```py
# loop through centroids for block group or tract
for bg in df.itertuples():
    # loop through parks
    for park in park_ids:
        these_points = park_points.loc[[park]]
        min_euc = float("inf")
        
        # loop through points associated with park
        for point in these_points.itertuples():
            # find closest park point by Euclidean distance
            dx = point.LONGITUDE - bg.LONGITUDE
            dy = point.LATITUDE - bg.LATITUDE
            euc_dist = math.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
            
            if euc_dist < min_euc:
                min_euc = euc_dist
                closest_point = point.node
                
        # compute shortest path between closest_point and centroid
        try:
            length = nx.shortest_path_length(graph, source=bg.node, target=closest_point, weight='length')
        except:
            # can fail if no path exists
            length = float("inf")
```


The network path is calculated in meters, because the UTM coordinates are in meters.

```{r writeout}
write_points_file <- function(points, file){
  points %>% 
    st_transform(4326) %>%
    mutate(
      LATITUDE = st_coordinates(.)[, 2],
      LONGITUDE = st_coordinates(.)[, 1]
    ) %>%
    st_transform(this_utm) %>%
    mutate(
      Y = st_coordinates(.)[, 2],
      X = st_coordinates(.)[, 1]
    ) %>%
    st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
    write_csv(file)
}
park_points     %>% write_points_file(here("data/park_points.csv"))
street_points   %>% write_points_file(here("data/street_points.csv"))
bg_centroids    %>% write_points_file(here("data/bg_centroids.csv"))
```

## Distance Examination

After computing the distance between the block group centroids and the park points,
we examine the relationship between the Euclidean and network distances, as well
as the geographical location of the points. Figure \@ref(fig:dist-exploration)
shows this comparison, and it appears that the network distances are rationally longer.

```{r read_distances}
bg <- read_rds(here("data/blockgroups.rds"))
# download shortest paths data calculated on MaryLou
shortest_paths_7z <- here("data/shortest_paths.7z")
shortest_paths <- here("data/shortest_paths")
if(!dir.exists(shortest_paths)){
  if(!file.exists(shortest_paths_7z)) {
    download.file("https://byu.box.com/shared/static/96tx18jcpcy47xg2mbbdig6zcrbru6x7.7z",
                  shortest_paths_7z)
  }
  system2("7z", c("e", shortest_paths_7z, str_c("-o", shortest_paths)) )
}

distance_files <- list.files(shortest_paths, "*.csv", full.names = TRUE)
read_dist_csv <- function(x){
  # warnings are from `inf` strings, which become converted to NA, which is okay.
  suppressWarnings(read_csv(x, col_types = "ccnn") %>% as_tibble() %>%
                     mutate(geoid = str_pad(geoid, 12, "left", "0") ))
}

distances <- lapply(distance_files, read_dist_csv) %>% 
  bind_rows() %>%
  left_join(dist_bg_euc %>% rename(miles = distance), by = c("geoid", "park_id")) %>%
  mutate(distance = distance * 0.000621371,
         euc_dist = euc_dist * 0.000621371)
```

```{r dist-exploration, fig.cap="Comparison of Euclidean and walk network distances."}
ggplot(distances %>% sample_n(1e5), aes(y = distance, x = miles)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +  geom_abline(slope = 1, lty = "dashed") + 
  xlab("Euclidean distance [miles]") + ylab("Network distance [miles]") +
  theme_bw()
```


The map below shows the distance from a park to all block groups, and it appears
as though the paths are correct and rational. 
```{r distance-map}
pal <- colorQuantile(palette = "magma", log(distances$distance), n = 9)
bg %>%
  select(geoid) %>%
  left_join(distances %>% filter(park_id == "29615"), by = "geoid") %>%
  st_transform(4326) %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldGrayCanvas) %>%
  addPolygons(color = ~pal(log(distance)), group = "Network") %>%
  addPolygons(color = ~pal(log(euc_dist)), group = "Euclidean") %>%
  addPolygons(color = ~pal(log(miles)), group = "SF-Euclidean") %>%
  addLayersControl(overlayGroups = c("Network", "Euclidean", "SF-Euclidean"))
```
