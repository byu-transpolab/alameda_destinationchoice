Understanding who has access to parks is a long-standing question across
multiple scientific disciplines. Researchers specializing in recreation
management, public health, urban planning, ecology, and civil engineering have
all played a role in shaping our collective understanding of park design,
access, and use. A complete review of all of these fields is not warranted for
the scope of this paper, but some recent findings are worth discussion.

A popular measure of park accessibility is the Trust for Public Land’s
“ParkScore” statistic [@parkscore2019]. ParkScore considers the share of the
population that resides within a 10-minute walk of a green space using a
sophisticated network routing algorithm, in combination with the total city
green space, investment, and amenities weighted against the socioeconomic
characteristics of the population outside of the 10-minute walk threshold. The
resulting score is a convenient quantitative tool in estimating the relative
quality of green space access across cities [@Rigolon2018]. It may be less
useful at identifying the comparative quality of access within a city,
particularly as more than 95% of residents in many large metropolitan areas like
San Francisco and New York live within the binary 10-minute walk threshold. The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed an "Accessibility
to Parks Indicator" along similar lines [@Ussery2016], calculating the share of
the population living within a half-mile of a park for each county in the U.S.

There is recognition that park access should in some way be linked with park
use. After all, a park that has many visitors must by definition be accessible
to those visitors. @McCormack2010 provide a comprehensive review of this
literature; it is sufficient here to note that most studies find a complicated
interplay between park size, maintenance, facilities, and travel distance. Many
of these attributes are incorporated into ParkIndex [@Kaczynski2016], which
estimates the resident park use potential within $100 m^2$ grid cells, based on
a household park use survey in Kansas City.

From a transportation engineering perspective, the park use potential measured
by ParkIndex is not dissimilar from a park trip production potential. Along
these lines, the question of park use is a destination choice problem, where
trip makers consider which park is most attractive to accomplish their
recreation activity. The Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip
Generation Manual [-@ite2019] contains trip attraction rates for public parks
that use as attraction terms the park acreage, number of picnic tables,
employees, and other variables. As with many land uses in Trip Generation, the
provided trip generation rates are based on a limited number of observational
samples and may not represent large-sample behavior [@Millard-Ball2015].
Moreover, regression-based attraction rates isolated from trip production and
travel behavior ignore the geographical and behavioral contexts in which people
actually make trips to parks [@Barnard1987]: Though more people may come to
larger parks, a park cannot attract more people simply by becoming bigger.

There are limited examples of researchers using a destination choice model to
predict recreation attractions. @Kinnell2006 apply a choice model to a survey
of park visitors in New Jersey, and estimate the relative attractiveness of park
attributes including playgrounds, picnic areas, and park acreage weighed against
the travel disutility and the relative crime rate at the destination. In a
similar study, @Meyerhoff2010 model the urban swimming location choice for a
surveyed sample. In both studies, the researchers were attempting to ascertain
which attributes of a recreation generated the most positive utility, and
therefore which attributes should be prioritized for improvement. These studies
have not to our knowledge been previously referenced in discussions of park
accessibility.

## Passive Location Data

The advent of large-scale mobile networks and the seemingly perpetual
association of unique devices with unique users has given researchers a new
opportunity to observe the movements and activity location patterns for large
subsets of the population [@Naboulsi2016]. Such passively collected movement
data --- sometimes referred to as “Big Data” --- is passively collected as a
by-product of other systems including cellular call data records  [e.g.,
@Bolla2000; @Calabrese2011], probe GPS data [@Huang2015], and more recently
Location Based Services (LBS) [@Roll2019; @Komanduri2017]. LBS use a network of
mobile applications that obtain the users’ physical location. A variety of
commercial vendors repackage, clean, and scale these data to population or
traffic targets and sell origin-destination matrices to researchers and
practitioners at relatively low prices. @monz2019using, for example, demonstrate
how passive device data can be used to accurately estimate trips to natural
recreation areas.

Passive origin-destination matrices are beginning to inform trip distribution
model development more directly as well. @tf_idea proposes one methodology,
where passive origin-destination matrices serve as a probabilistic sampling
frame for a simulated trip destination choice. @Bernardin2018 employ a passive
origin-destination matrix as a shadow price reference in an activity-based
location choice model, iteratively adjusting the parameters of the choice
utilities to minimize the observed error between the matrix and the modeled
predictions. A similar method developed by @Zhu2018 uses the passive dataset
directly, sampling 10,000 random trips from GPS traces of taxi trips in Shanghai
and estimating a destination choice model. Employing the passive data set in
this way provides the authors an opportunity to examine the choices of a
large sample of a small population (taxi passengers) as well as sufficient data
to estimate a “constants-rich” destination choice model with uniquely estimated
coefficients for each origin-destination pair. The Zhu and Ye methodology
suggests that a similar approach should apply in other contexts, including park
choice.
