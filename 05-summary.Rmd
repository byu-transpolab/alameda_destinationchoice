# Limitations and Future Directions
The ideal dataset for estimating individual choices would be a high-quality,
large-sample household travel survey of real individuals. Such a survey would
give details on whether an observed trip to a park was actually a recreation
trip or rather a different activity entirely. The individual-level demographic
data would also be valuable in understanding more clearly the observed
heterogeneity in response among different income or ethnic groups. Additionally,
the trends and correlations revealed in the presented models may reflect
situational inequalities rather than true preferences. For example, the 
distinct observed parameters on size and distance for minority block groups may
indicate that areas with large minority populations tend to have smaller parks
that are more geographically distributed relative to other regions of the region.
Transit access may also affect park choice and how far people are willing to
travel to access a park. Preliminary analysis of our source data indicates a
qualitative correlation between good transit access and diverse park use from
both a geographic and demographic perspective.

We limited our analysis to home locations and parks in Alameda County,
California. It is possible that some Alameda residents visit parks in
neighboring counties, just as it is possible that parks in Alameda County
attract trips from outside the county borders. This is most likely for block
groups and parks on the north and south borders of the county. The lower
measured accessibility in the area around Berkeley in the northern part of the
county () is likely affected by the ommission of parks and residents in Contra
Costa County.

Using Euclidean distance to represent the distance between the block group
centroid and the border of the park leaves something to be desired: Depending on
network topography and built environment characteristics, there may be a
significant variation in perceived travel times between two parks with similar
straight-line distances. That said, a more precise network-based measure might
not overcome the inaccuracies resulting from our necessarily measuring distances
from the block group centroid. As above, an individual-level survey where the
home location is explicitly known would be preferable regardless of the distance
method employed.

The activity location data used in this specific analysis treats all days of the
week and day periods together; it is likely that weekend park choice is
substantially different from weekday choice, as the activities performed may be
the same. Also recall that the data consider each device-park pair as a unique
trip. Repeated trips to the same park may not be properly considered in the data
sample. A more precise time-of-day and day-of-week segmentation is warranted.

We applied a naive random sampling of the alternatives in our model estimation
and validation; a more considered approach involving hierarchical destination
sampling may yield more efficient estimates and therefore a clearer picture of
the role of size, distance, and other amenities on the observed choices. The 
relatively weak predictive power of such a simple model formulation (size and
distance only) indicates that there is potential to examine the role that
additional park amenities --- ball fields, playgrounds, water features, etc. ---
play in the relative attractiveness of parks for different market segments. The
quality of park maintenance is another important feature identified in the
recreation literature [@Fletcher2003] that is not included here.

# Conclusions

As transportation professionals seek to improve access to parks and better
coordinate transportation and land use efforts --- and as researchers more
generally try to understand the role parks and open spaces play in public health
and society --- it is increasingly important to better understand how, when, and
why individuals travel to parks. This intersection between recreation and
transportation has received relatively little exploration, partially because
travel survey data emphasizes weekday travel and because the role of parks in
daily activities can be more complicated than with other land uses. This study
contributes to the understanding of recreation access by presenting a method to
develop access measures explicitly based on the observed choices of individuals.
The resulting access measure is continuously defined and incorporates multiple
dimensions of access, including the travel necessary to reach all nearby parks
as well as the amenities of each of those parks.  Further, the measure we have
presented reveals heterogeneous preferences for travel and park size across
market segments, a heterogeneity that could perhaps be incorporated into an
understanding of accessibility.

With the growing availability of passive transportation data, there is a
correspondingly increased opportunity to explore such data to develop a better
understanding of travel patterns in more careful detail than is possible with
household travel surveys. Capturing a sufficiently large survey to study trip
patterns to a single park is an enormous undertaking, and doing such an exercise
for an entire park system is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Passive
data sets therefore enable analyses that would be unlikely or impossible by
other means. Challenges to the representativeness and comprehensiveness of
passive data products are in many cases fair, but this should not preclude their
use in cases where traditional techniques are not practicable.
