# Limitations and Future Directions {#limitations}
The utility-based accessibility metrics we present and apply in this paper are 
evaluated from a discrete choice model estimated on simulate decision makers
constructed from a third-party passive origin-destination matrix. This methodological
choice has some strengths: Foremost among these is the ability to readily and
affordably construct a large dataset on an infrequent trip purpose. 
Most destination choice and activity location models are estimated on 
small-sample household travel surveys. Securing sufficient responses to estimate
a rich behavioral model on a trip purpose as infrequent as parks has proven 
prohibitively expensive outside of extensive research activities 
[e.g., @Kaczynski2016]. Using passive data sets to increase the effective 
sampling rate possible in a discrete choice model is a potentially powerful strategy,
and its application here is an important contribution of our work.

At the same time, passive data sets available from commercial providers do not
reveal any details about the specific trip makers beyond what can be learned 
from their residence block group. In this research we were able to determine 
whether a device resided in a block group with a high proportion of low-income
households, but could not have confidence that a particular device belonged 
to a member of such a household. Similarly, there is no information on what kind
of trip the device-holder actually accomplished at each park. The ideal dataset
for estimating individual park activity location choices would be a
high-quality, large-sample household travel survey of real individuals. Such a
survey would give details on whether an observed trip to a park was actually a
recreation trip or rather a different activity entirely. 

The individual-level demographic data would also be valuable in understanding
more clearly the observed heterogeneity in response among different income or
ethnic groups.  Additionally, the trends and correlations revealed in the
presented models may reflect situational inequities rather than true
preferences. For example, the distinct observed parameters on size and distance
for minority block groups may indicate that areas with large minority
populations tend to have smaller parks that are more geographically distributed
relative to other regions of the region. This could also explain some of the 
non-intuitive response observed in our models, especially in regards to
playgrounds.

We limited our analysis to home locations and parks in Alameda County,
California. It is possible that some Alameda residents visit parks in
neighboring counties, just as it is possible that parks in Alameda County
attract trips from outside the county borders. This is most likely for block
groups and parks on the north and south borders of the county. The scope of this 
analysis was determined by the passive data set available for the research, but 
the county boundaries are not a general requirement for all studies of this kind.

The distance to a park was represented in this study using a walk network retrieved
from the OpenStreetMap project. Though perhaps superior to a Euclidean distance, 
this measure still has many limitations. First, we were unable to verify the 
integrity of the underlying network information; based on our prior experience,
it is likely that some broken or improperly connected links artificially
inflated the measured distance for an unknown number of park / block group 
pairs. A more serious limitation, however, is that experienced travel distances
are a function of the transport mode employed by the traveler. Using bare 
distances does not provide any detail on how access to parks might be increased
with improved transit service, for example. Using a mode-choice model logsum
as a multi-modal impedance term in the activity location choice model would
enable this kind of analysis.

# Conclusions {#conclusions}



As transportation professionals seek to improve access to parks and better
coordinate transportation and land use efforts --- and as researchers more
generally try to understand the role parks and open spaces play in public health
and society --- it is increasingly important to better understand how, when, and
why individuals travel to parks. This intersection between recreation and
transportation has received relatively little exploration, partially because
travel survey data emphasizes weekday travel and because the role of parks in
daily activities can be more complicated than with other land uses. This study
contributes to the understanding of recreation access by presenting a method to
develop access measures explicitly based on the observed choices of individuals.
The resulting access measure is continuously defined and incorporates multiple
dimensions of access, including the travel necessary to reach all nearby parks
as well as the amenities of each of those parks.  Further, the measure we have
presented reveals heterogeneous preferences for travel and park size across
market segments, a heterogeneity that could perhaps be incorporated into an
understanding of accessibility.

With the growing availability of passive transportation data, there is a
correspondingly increased opportunity to explore such data to develop a better
understanding of travel patterns in more careful detail than is possible with
household travel surveys. Capturing a sufficiently large survey to study trip
patterns to a single park is an enormous undertaking, and doing such an exercise
for an entire park system is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Passive
data sets therefore enable analyses that would be unlikely or impossible by
other means. Challenges to the representativeness and comprehensiveness of
passive data products are in many cases fair, but this should not preclude their
use in cases where traditional techniques are not practicable.
