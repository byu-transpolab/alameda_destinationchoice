## My Template Article

The `bookdown` example template has a lot going for it, but there are a number 
of complicated changes I need to make every time I start a new article. So this
template has the changes pre-made!

Changes from the default `bookdown` template include:

  - The html output is put in `docs` instead of `_book`, which makes it easy to
  host the website through GitHub pages.
  - The pdf output generates an `article` instead of a `book`. The specific 
  LaTeX template is the Elsevier template, where most of my articles have been
  published to date.
  - The keys for the article template are already set up.
