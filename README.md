## Park Destination Choice in Alameda County

 Parks provide important benefits to those who live near them, in the form of
 improved property values, health outcomes, etc.; nevertheless, measuring and
 understanding who lives near a park is an open research question. In
 particular, it is not well understood which park individuals will choose to use
 when given a choice among a set of nearby parks of varying sizes and at varying
 distances from their home. In this paper we present a park activity location
 choice model estimated from a passive origin-destination dataset --- supplied
 by StreetLight Data, Inc. --- representing trips to parks and green spaces in
 Alameda County, California. The estimated model parameters reveal heterogeneous
 preferences for park size and willingness-to-travel across block-group level
 socioeconomic segmentation: Specifically, high-income block groups appear more
 positively attracted to larger parks, and block groups with a high proportion
 of ethnic minority individuals are more likely to select nearby parks. The
 findings have importance for understanding recreational access among different
 populations, and the methodology more generally supplies a potential template
 for using passive data products within travel modeling.
